# Movies-ETL

For this challenge I recycled a lot of code from the module and needed a lot of help from assistants and tutors. I do not think I grasp this topic as well as I have others before it. I am submitting it now becasue I have compared my output to that which is desired within the Module 8 Challenge framework. I am still struggling with Module 6 and have not even gotten to the challenge so I am taking what I assume is an 85 and intend to circle back and update this repository with the final deliverable, merging the datasets. For now, I just want to know if my work so far passes so I do not have to worry about it. This class is getting difficult. 

# Background

Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. You’ll need to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

# Deliverable 1

Using your knowledge of Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, write a function that reads in the three data files and creates three separate DataFrames.

# Deliverable 2

Using your knowledge of Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, extract and transform the Wikipedia data so you can merge it with the Kaggle metadata. While extracting the IMDb IDs using a regular expression string and dropping duplicates, use a try-except block to catch errors.

# Deliverable 3 

Using your knowledge of Python, Pandas, the ETL process, and code refactoring, extract and transform the Kaggle metadata and MovieLens rating data, then convert the transformed data into separate DataFrames. Then, you’ll merge the Kaggle metadata DataFrame with the Wikipedia movies DataFrame to create the movies_df DataFrame. Finally, you’ll merge the MovieLens rating data DataFrame with the movies_df DataFrame to create the movies_with_ratings_df.

# Deliverable 4

Deliverable 4 will be provided when I feel I have the appropriate time to complete it to the best of my ability.
